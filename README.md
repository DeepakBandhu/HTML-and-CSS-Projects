# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains my HTML and CSS Projects from The Tech Academy online course. 
I've made many project in this course, some web pages, others are me practicing and element, and others can possibly be used for my resume.
Some of the files uploaded have a mistake but still run.
As the course progressed, there were less mistakes.
At this point I feel confident that I can produce HTML and CSS code that runs properly with no errors.
