# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains my HTML and CSS Projects from The Tech Academy online course. 
Some of the files uploaded have a mistake but still run.
As the course progressed, there were less mistakes.
At this point I feel confident that I can produce HTML and CSS code that runs properly with no errors.
